# Moodle H5p Solver
This script was written over a year ago to get answers for H5p quizzes on moodle. The answers to these questions are checked on the client side, making it possible to get the answers.

## Usage
1. Open developer tools window on your browser.
2. Paste either of the getAnswers.js/autoSolve.js in the console. (getAnswers.js will just open another window with the answers, autoSolve.js will try to solve the quiz automatically, if you are feeling extra lazy)
3. Press enter.

## getAnswers.js
